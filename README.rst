What is this?
=============

This is a pytest plugin that enables you to test your code that relies on a running Elasticsearch search engine.
It allows you to specify fixtures for Elasticsearch process and client.

How to use
==========

.. warning::

    This plugin requires at least version 5.0 of elasticsearch to work.

The plugin contains two fixtures:

* **elasticsearch** - a client fixture that has functional scope, and which
  cleans Elasticsearch at the end of each test.
* **elasticsearch_proc** - a session scoped fixture, that starts Elasticsearch
  instance at its first use and stops at the end of the tests.
* **elasticsearch_nooproc** - a nooprocess fixture, that's holds connection data
  to already running elasticsearch

Simply include one of these fixtures into your tests fixture list.

You can also create additional elasticsearch client and process fixtures if you'd need to:


.. code-block:: python

    from pytest_elasticsearch import factories

    elasticsearch_my_proc = factories.elasticsearch_proc(port=None)
    elasticsearch_my = factories.elasticsearch('elasticsearch_my_proc')

.. note::

    Each elasticsearch process fixture can be configured in a different way than the others through the fixture factory arguments.


Connecting to already existing Elasticsearch service
----------------------------------------------------

Some projects are using already running Elasticsearch servers
(ie on docker instances). In order to connect to them, one would be using the
``elasticsearch_nooproc`` fixture.

.. code-block:: python

    es_external = factories.elasticsearch('elasticsearch_nooproc')

By default the  ``elasticsearch_nooproc`` fixture would connect to elasticsearch
instance using **9300** port.

Configuration
=============

You can define your settings in three ways, it's fixture factory argument, command line option and pytest.ini configuration option.
You can pick which you prefer, but remember that these settings are handled in the following order:

1. Fixture factory argument
2. Command line option
3. Configuration option in your pytest.ini file

     - transport_tcp_port
     - --elasticsearch-transport-tcp-port
     - elasticsearch_transport_tcp_port
     - -
     - random

Example usage:

* pass it as an argument in your own fixture

    .. code-block:: python

        elasticsearch_proc = factories.elasticsearch_proc(
            cluster_name='awsome_cluster)


* specify your directory as ``elasticsearch_cluster_name`` in your ``pytest.ini`` file.

    To do so, put a line like the following under the ``[pytest]`` section of your ``pytest.ini``:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        elasticsearch_cluster_name = awsome_cluster

Known issues
------------

It might happen, that the process can't be started due to lack of permissions.
The files that user running tests has to have access to are:

* /etc/default/elasticsearch

Make sure that you either run tests as a user that has access to these files,
or you give user proper permissions or add it to proper user groups.

In CI at the moment, we install elasticsearch from tar/zip archives,
which do not set up additional permission restrictions, so it's not a problem on the CI/CD.
